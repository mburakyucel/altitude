# Changelog

Release notes describe user-visible behavior, compatibility and recovery. The project is a private
preview; see [release checkpoints](docs/RELEASING.md). An Unreleased entry is not a published release.

## Unreleased

- Model allowance exhaustion is recognized without inventing a reset time. Coordinators can use
  `alt task handoff` to continue an exited, fault-blocked owner as a fresh attempt on another
  configured engine, preserving saved work, task history, PRs, questions and merge holds (#310).
- Protected Git hooks allow reference packing, loose-copy pruning and fetch garbage collection
  while main lags origin/main, preserving its tip and subsequent permitted fast-forward. Genuine
  unauthorized protected branch moves and deletions remain blocked (#291).
- Landing accepts a nonrequired skipped deployment with immutable condition
  `github.event_name != 'pull_request'` for an associated `pull_request` run. Required checks,
  exact candidate/source validation and at least one applicable passing check remain mandatory (#288).
- Mobile L3 and L2 chat use one compact header and composer, with bottom navigation hidden during
  detected software keyboard use and restored on dismissal. Task details hold metadata, full
  blocked/merge-hold reasons and existing actions; concise status, actionable failures and pending
  questions remain accessible. Drafts and reading position survive keyboard and details transitions.
- Full Python, web, build and phone/desktop browser checks run with disposable fictional state
  and deterministic external-engine fixtures. Core task delivery, messaging/resume and failure
  paths have programmatic integration evidence; routine checks make no model calls.
- Daily private-preview readiness and as-needed patch releases define candidate validation, versioning, notes and
  recovery. Version publication is explicit; merged changes continue activating automatically.
- Live-provider testing, including the real tiny validation task, is deferred under the operator's
  testing policy. See the [coverage limits](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#coverage-and-limits).
