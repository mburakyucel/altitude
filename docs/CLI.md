# Altitude CLI

`bin/alt` is the one engine-neutral door into Altitude. `--project <name>` or
`ALTITUDE_PROJECT=<name>` selects a project. Commands that change task state are validated against the
task record and current attempt under the project lock.

Start with [setup](SETUP.md) to build the app, install project Git guards, register a project
with Auto preferences or explicit pins, and start a conversation. `alt project add` registers state; it does
not install Git guards. [Operations](OPERATIONS.md) covers project settings and service lifecycle.

## Inspection

`alt task status <slug>` and `alt task report <slug> --json` include `token_usage`: the daemon's
persisted local token observation, independent of the report's agent-authored spend. It contains
inclusive input/output and their observed total, optional cache/reasoning subsets, session rows with
engine/attempt/owner or delegated attribution, coverage notes, and checked/observed/finalized times.
These commands do not rescan provider logs. Missing counters remain null or partial; archived tasks
retain their final observation. See [token semantics](SESSION_LIFECYCLE.md#task-token-accounting).

These commands are read-only. They print compact text unless `--json` is present:

```text
alt task report <slug> [--json]
alt task messages <slug> [--last N] [--json]
alt task events <slug> [--last N] [--json]
alt queue [--json]
alt repo [--json]
alt pr <number> [--json]
alt l3 tools [--days N] [--json]
```

`alt task status <slug> --brief` prints at most ten orientation lines. `alt task status <slug>` and
its explicit `--json` form return the complete status record. `alt task show <slug>` is an alias for
that same record. `alt monitor` reports quota and live provider sessions; `alt decisions` reports
tasks waiting for Burak.

`alt l3 tools` groups the shell commands persisted with recent L3 turns. Commands outside the `alt`
door appear first so recurring inspection pipelines are easy to replace with known verbs.

An L3 process is read-only on the deployment checkout and Altitude home. Its direct shell reads are limited
to Git log/diff-stat/show-stat and the altitude user journal. Runtime shims carry every `alt` invocation plus
`gh pr` view/list/diff/checks, GitHub issue/run inspection, and altitude service status over that project's
same-user altd Unix socket. The socket fixes the project independently of request data. The broker re-applies the
L3 command door, accepts flat task identifiers and stdin rather than `--file`, and binds GitHub reads to the project's
repository; source editing, Git writes, direct GitHub mutations, service control, direct command networking, and cross-project verbs are unavailable.

## GitHub issues

```text
alt issue new --title <title> [--label <label>] -
alt issue comment <number> -
alt issue close <number> --reason completed|not-planned
```

L3 and the operator use these verbs through altd; L2 cannot mutate issues. L3 files requested backlog
and closes an issue only when the operator asks for that closure, never as autonomous backlog cleanup.
The repository comes from the selected project's checkout origin; issue numbers must be positive
integers, and URLs or repository overrides are refused. The L3 socket fixes the project.

New and comment read their public body from stdin; titles, labels, and bodies must exclude home paths
and private incident evidence; recognizable credentials and tokens are rejected too. Close requires `--reason completed` for finished work or
`--reason not-planned` for work the operator decides not to pursue. Altd maps the latter to GitHub's
`not planned` reason. Close accepts no stdin body, title, labels, or comment option; a separately
requested public explanation uses `alt issue comment` and its existing evidence check. No other issue
mutations or direct `gh` writes are enabled except the create-only upstream report below.

The coordinator MCP tool takes, for example,
`{"kind":"alt","args":["issue","close","42","--reason","completed"]}`.
The operator CLI uses `POST /api/issue` with
`{"project":"<name>","operation":"close","number":42,"reason":"completed"}`;
`body` may be omitted or empty. Both paths apply the same operation validation and return the issue
URL. The socket fixes actor `l3`; HTTP fixes actor `operator`. A successful closure appends an
`issue-close` project event with actor, number, reason, title, and URL; failed calls record no success.

### Upstream Altitude defects

```sh
alt issue upstream --title "Fictional resume defect" - <<'JSON'
{
  "expected": "The fictional Atlas task resumes once.",
  "actual": "The task remains blocked.",
  "reproduction": "Create a toy project, block its task, then request resume.",
  "version": "example-build-123"
}
JSON
```

L3 can explicitly report an Altitude defect from any managed project. The command creates only a
GitHub issue in the installation's Altitude issue repository; it does not fix Altitude, create a
recovery task, wake Altitude's L3, or copy local incidents or conversations. Altitude's
operator/coordinator selects implementation separately. Ordinary recovery for the project's own
problems stays in that project. Reporting does not enable automatic issue-to-task intake.

Stdin is a JSON object with nonempty `expected`, `actual`, and `reproduction` strings, plus optional
`version` (an Altitude release or commit if known; omission publishes `unknown`). Other fields are
refused. Author a small fictional or redacted reproduction, never paste operational logs, incident
evidence or conversation transcripts. All public fields, including the title and version, pass the
same home-path, private-evidence and credential checks as ordinary issues. These checks catch
recognizable patterns; the author must still redact private or security-sensitive details.
Use `[REDACTED]` for a credential placeholder.

The product target seam is `ALTITUDE_UPSTREAM_ISSUE_REPOSITORY` in **altd's environment**, an
operator-configured GitHub `owner/repository` or GitHub origin URL. Unset uses the installed
Altitude source checkout's GitHub origin. A fork installation can configure its intended upstream
there. An invalid or unavailable target fails with configuration instructions, with no fallback to
the reporting project's repository. L3 cannot change this setting through the reporting verb;
neither request fields nor the caller's environment choose the target. No `--repo`, `--target`,
`--project`, file attachment, label, issue number, upstream comment or closure is accepted.

The coordinator MCP tool receives argument arrays and a JSON string on stdin:

```json
{"kind":"alt","args":["issue","upstream","--title","Fictional resume defect","-"],"stdin":"{\"expected\":\"Resume once\",\"actual\":\"Still blocked\",\"reproduction\":\"Create a toy project, block its task, request resume\"}"}
```

The runtime `alt` shim uses the same project-bound broker. The operator CLI uses `POST /api/issue`
with `project`, `operation: "upstream"`, `title` and `body` (the same JSON string); L2 issue writes
remain denied. Success returns the issue URL and writes one `issue-upstream` event with actor,
title and URL in the calling project's log, without the report body. Failures name configuration,
GitHub authentication/access, or an unconfirmed result without echoing GitHub's private error output.
After a timeout or unconfirmed response, the operator checks the target's issues before retrying to
avoid duplicates; L3's GitHub read broker remains project-local.

## Project lifecycle

`alt project remove <name>` is operator-only. Removing a project from Altitude means detaching its
L3: it unregisters an idle project and stops coordination. Finish or reject queued, running,
blocked and reported tasks first, and wait for live workers, launch/resume operations, L3 turns
and task processing to finish. A refusal leaves registration and work intact.

The repository, remaining worktrees, conversations, provider sessions, task archives and queued
L3 messages stay on disk. `alt project add <name> --path <same-repository>` attaches L3 again and
restores that history; queued messages become eligible for delivery again. The same removal is in
the project's **More actions** menu (`POST /api/project/remove` with `{"name":"<name>"}`).
The existing folder-add flow (`POST /api/project/add`) attaches L3 again. `alt l3-reset` remains a
separate conversation reset; it marks a session for rotation without disabling coordination.

### Automatic routing preferences

The operator and a project's L3 can set that project's shared Auto policy for L3 turns and fresh
L2 attempts through the existing operational settings command:

```sh
alt project set example --routing 'codex,claude:fable>claude:opus' --reason 'Prefer these peers; keep Opus as fallback'
alt project set example --unset-routing --reason 'Restore default Auto preferences'
```

Quote the policy so the shell does not interpret `>`. Options use `engine[:model]`; commas tie
options, and `>` starts a lower-priority tier. An omitted model uses the engine's role default.
Empty tiers/options, duplicate options and unknown engines are rejected. The daemon applies the
request on its next tick and records actor, reason and outcome. No PR, restart, UI setting or free
task slot is needed. `alt project list` shows the stored override; `alt monitor` explains each
project's L3 and fresh L2 choice, including its tier, skipped options and unknown quota.

Auto uses the highest tier with an eligible option. Only comparable, named seven-day account
readings select by headroom within a tie; short windows only determine availability. Unknown or
incomparable weekly readings use configured tie order. An L3 engine/model still eligible in that
tier stays unless a competing option has at least fifteen percentage points more weekly headroom.
Default preferences tie Codex's default model with Claude Fable and put Opus below them;
`ALTITUDE_PRIMARY_ENGINE` chooses only the default tie order. A project override replaces the
whole preference list, and `--unset-routing` restores those defaults.

| Intended preference | `--routing` value |
| --- | --- |
| Claude-only account with Opus available | `'claude:opus'` |
| Fable unavailable; prefer Codex with Opus as fallback | `'codex>claude:opus'` |
| Fable and Codex tied; prefer Fable when weekly quota is unknown | `'claude:fable,codex>claude:opus'` |
| Same tie; prefer Codex when weekly quota is unknown | `'codex,claude:fable>claude:opus'` |
| Prefer Opus first, then Codex | `'claude:opus>codex'` |

A missing CLI, exhausted window or known access rejection excludes the affected options; unknown
access or quota remains eligible. No plan name implies model entitlement, and a shared account
meter does not supply separate Fable/Opus allowances. If Fable rejects access while Codex is absent,
the default policy can try Opus after confirming no output or tool effects occurred. A model
rejection excludes that model for thirty minutes; an authentication rejection excludes the engine
for thirty minutes. A rejection of an unresolved native default is scoped to that role, since
the two launchers can use different default models. Each alternative is tried at most once per dispatch or turn. When none is
eligible, the explanation identifies installation, authentication, reset or configuration actions.

Preferences are distinct from explicit pins. `alt task new --engine claude --model opus …` pins
one task; project `--l2-engine`/`--l3-engine` pins, the composer's L3 engine choice and
`alt chat --engine …` take precedence over Auto and never silently fall back. An explicit model pin
also remains strict. Changing preferences does not unpin them or change a running L2: resume keeps
that attempt's engine, provider session and recorded launch model. A quota fallback is a recorded
fresh attempt from `progress.md`. L3 retains a separate provider conversation per engine, including
when its chosen model changes; crossing providers supplies missed human conversation without
replaying tool logs. See [session lifecycle](SESSION_LIFECYCLE.md#messages-resume-and-stop).

## Task lifecycle

```text
alt task new --title <title> [--paths a.py,b/] [--hold-merge <reason>] -
alt task message <slug> <text>
alt task reply <text>
alt task block <slug> --reason <reason> [--for-burak | --fault]  # current L2 only
alt task escalate <slug> --question <question>
alt task resume|stop <slug> --reason <reason>
alt task hold-merge <slug> --why <reason>  # Burak alone may use --off
alt task done <slug> --digest <text>
alt task reject <slug> --reason <reason>
```

Repository changes use `alt land --message <message> [--merge]`. Project, incident, service, TLS,
and installation commands remain available through `bin/alt --help` and the relevant subcommand
help.

For L3 and shell callers, `resume`, `stop`, and `reject` append one task-local daemon request and one
`daemon-request` event containing the task, operation, actor, reason, and request id. Altd performs the
worker or session effect, refuses a changed state or identity, and makes an identical retry idempotent.
A repeated reason after a genuine later lifecycle creates a new request against that lifecycle's identity.
A message to a blocked task uses its durable inbox and `resume_after` handoff instead of launching a
worker in the caller. L3 cannot call `task block` directly: an L2 blocks itself with its attempt fence,
while L3 uses reason-bearing `task stop` so altd blocks the task and stops the same observed worker.

### Recorded merge approval

L3 can apply an existing operator authorization through its project-bound daemon connection:

```text
alt task hold-merge <slug> --approval <message-id> --pr-number <number> --head <full-sha> --reason <reason>
```

Read `alt task messages <slug> --json` for the durable message id and `alt pr <number> --json`
for the current PR head. The latest operator message must be exactly `Good to merge`, directly
after the owner's message containing the canonical GitHub PR URL and no other PR URL. The daemon
checks the current hold generation and reads the PR from the project's origin repository. It
requires an open, non-draft, same-repository PR targeting main on the task branch at the supplied
head, with GitHub's `updatedAt` strictly before the presentation and the presentation after the hold.
Missing or corrupt evidence, a later operator message, a renewed hold, or a later PR update refuses
release. This is deliberately conservative: even a later PR comment or description edit invalidates
this evidence path. Arbitrary approval wording is not interpreted.

Success returns a receipt with the approval message id/time, presentation id, prior hold/event,
PR URL/head and actual actor `l3`. The receipt is stored as `merge_approval` on the task and in a
`release-merge` event. Inspect `alt task show <slug>` and `alt task events <slug> --json` to confirm
the release before resuming a blocked owner. The operation neither resumes nor merges; the owner
rechecks and runs `alt land --merge`. With no active hold a repeated call refuses without another
release. Ordinary `--off` remains operator-only, and `--approval` cannot be combined with it or
`--why`. Standalone CLI execution of approval mode is refused; L3 uses its existing daemon transport.
